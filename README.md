# Voice Recognizer Model using Vosk

This project implements a voice recognition model using the Vosk library. It's designed to recognize spoken language and can be integrated with other tasks, such as summarizing a book or reading text aloud.

## Overview

This project utilizes the Vosk speech recognition toolkit, which provides high-accuracy offline speech recognition.  The recognized text can then be used to trigger various actions or workflows, like summarizing a book, reading text aloud, or other custom tasks.

## Features

* **Speech Recognition:**  Recognizes spoken language using the Vosk model.
* **Offline Recognition:** Performs speech recognition offline, without requiring an internet connection.
* **Integration with Tasks:**  Provides examples of integrating speech recognition with other tasks, such as:
    * **Book Summarization:**  Summarizes a book based on spoken input. *(If implemented)*
    * **Text-to-Speech:** Reads text aloud after voice recognition. *(If implemented)*
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **Vosk:**  For speech recognition.
   ```bash
   pip install vosk
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used (e.g., pyttsx3 for text-to-speech, libraries for book summarization, etc.). Be specific. For example:
Bash

pip install pyttsx3
[Language Model]: Specify the Vosk language model used. This is crucial, as Vosk requires a language model to be downloaded. Provide a link to the model or instructions on how to obtain it.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
Vosk Language Model: Download the appropriate Vosk language model. (Provide a link to the model download or clear instructions on how to get the model.)
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/Voice_recognizer_model_Using_VosK_model.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25253Fq%25253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%2525253Fq%2525253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%252525253Fq%252525253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25252525253Fq%25252525253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/Voice_recognizer_model_Using_VosK_model.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd Voice_recognizer_model_Using_VosK_model
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Place Language Model:  Place the downloaded Vosk language model in the appropriate directory. (Specify the directory where the model should be placed.)

Running the Code
Run the Script:
Bash

python voice_recognizer.py  # Replace voice_recognizer.py with the name of your script
(Explain any command-line arguments or configuration options.)
Usage
Speak: Speak into your microphone.
Recognition: The application will use Vosk to recognize your speech.
Task Execution: The recognized text will be used to perform the associated task (e.g., summarize a book, read text aloud). (Explain how the tasks are triggered and what actions are performed.)
Integration with Tasks
(Explain how the voice recognition is integrated with the other tasks. For example:)

Book Summarization: Describe how the spoken input is used to select and summarize a book. Which summarization techniques are used?
Text-to-Speech: Explain how the recognized text is converted to speech. Which text-to-speech engine is used?

Key improvements:

* **Clear Overview:** Explains the purpose of the project.
* **Features:** Highlights the key features.
* **Technologies Used:** Lists the technologies and includes installation instructions.  *Critically*, it emphasizes the need to specify the Vosk language model and how to obtain it.
* **Detailed Getting Started:** Provides step-by-step instructions.
* **Usage Instructions:** Explains how to use the application.
* **Integration with Tasks:**  This is a *crucial* section. You *must* explain how the voice recognition is integrated with the other tasks (book summarization, text-to-speech, etc.).  Be specific about the methods and libraries used.  This is what users will be most interested in.
* **Contact Information:** Includes contact information.
* **License:** Reminds you to add a license.
